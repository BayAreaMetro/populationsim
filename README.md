# Bay Area PopulationSim Pipeline

This repository generates synthetic population and land use inputs for the Bay Areaâ€™s Travel Model Two (TM2), using PUMS and census data.

## Quick Start

1. **Set up your environment:**  
   See [bay_area/docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](bay_area/docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)

2. **Run the pipeline:**  
   ```sh
   python tm2_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Review outputs:**  
   See [bay_area/docs/FILE_FLOW.md](bay_area/docs/FILE_FLOW.md) for details on output files and their locations.

PopulationSim is an open platform for population synthesis.  It emerged
from Oregon DOT's desire to build a shared, open, platform that could be
easily adapted for statewide, regional, and urban transportation planning
needs.  PopulationSim is implemented in the
[ActivitySim](https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim) framework.
