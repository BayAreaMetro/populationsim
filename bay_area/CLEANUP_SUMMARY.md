- `test_gq_comparison_hypothesis.py` - Breakthrough discovery script

### ‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION FILES (Keep)
- `README_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md` - Complete analysis results documentation
- `CORRECTED_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.txt` - Executive summary of findings

### üóëÔ∏è REMOVED FILES (Cleaned Up)
- `analyze_corrected_populationsim_performance.py` - Comprehensive but slow version
- `create_corrected_maz_chart.py` - Specific visualization script
- `maz_control_vs_output_summary.py` - Intermediate analysis tool
- `corrected_populationsim_performance.png` - Generated chart (can be recreated)

## Key Discovery Summary

**PopulationSim Performance: EXCELLENT** ‚ú®
- Only -0.76% under-allocation (not +6.6% over-allocation as initially appeared)
- 76.9% of MAZs have perfect household allocation matches
- Strong correlation (R¬≤ = 0.87) between targets and synthetic results

The apparent "over-allocation" was due to incorrect comparison methodology mixing household types. PopulationSim properly allocated 201,168 Group Quarters households that were being incorrectly counted as regular household errors.

## Files Ready for Repository

All remaining analysis files have been cleaned up with proper documentation headers and are ready for check-in to the repository.
