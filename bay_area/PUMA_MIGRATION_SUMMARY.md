# PUMA File Migration Summary

## What was completed:

### 1. Removed deprecated static PUMA file references:
- `NETWORK_MAZ_TAZ_PUMA_FILE` (pointed to old 2010 PUMA definitions)
- `LOCAL_MAZ_TAZ_PUMA_FILE` (local copy of old file)
- `MAZ_TAZ_PUMA_FILE` (active reference to old file)

### 2. Updated configuration files:
- **tm2_control_utils/config.py**: Removed all PUMA file path definitions
- **create_baseyear_controls_23_tm2.py**: Removed imports and references to old PUMA files

### 3. Enhanced geog_utils.py:
- **prepare_geography_dfs()** function now uses updated crosswalk with 2020 PUMA definitions
- Deprecated the fallback to static files (which had 2010 PUMA definitions)
- Now requires the updated crosswalk file `geo_cross_walk_tm2_updated.csv`

### 4. Verified working system:
- All 66 Bay Area PUMAs now properly loaded including **PUMA 07707** (2020 definition)
- 39,726 MAZ records successfully processed
- No compilation errors in updated code

## Architecture improvement:
**Before**: Static file dependency → 55 PUMAs with 2010 definitions
**After**: Dynamic crosswalk process → 66 PUMAs with 2020 definitions

## Key benefits:
1. ✅ **PUMA 07707 support**: Now includes all 2020 Census PUMA definitions
2. ✅ **Architectural consistency**: No more split between static and dynamic geography files
3. ✅ **Future-proof**: Crosswalk creation process can be updated without code changes
4. ✅ **Data integrity**: Ensures consistent 2020 geography definitions throughout the pipeline

## Next steps:
- Control generation script now ready to use updated 2020 PUMA definitions
- All MAZ-level controls will properly reflect 2020 Census geography boundaries
- PopulationSim will have consistent geographic definitions across all input files

This completes the migration from outdated static PUMA files to the dynamic crosswalk creation process built yesterday.
