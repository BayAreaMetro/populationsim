- **Vehicle ownership rates** reflect Bay Area transit patterns
- **Group Quarters populations** properly distributed by institution type

## Technical Improvements Implemented

### Pipeline Enhancements:
1. **Updated to 2.5 shapefiles** with 39,585 MAZ zones
2. **Tightened convergence criteria** (rel_tolerance: 0.001, abs_tolerance: 1.0)
3. **Integrated postprocessing** as pipeline step
4. **Added COUNTY field** via crosswalk merge for Group Quarters support
5. **Generated unique identifiers** (unique_per_id, WKW fields) for TM2 compatibility

### Data Processing Features:
- **Memory-efficient sampling** for large dataset analysis
- **Automatic type conversion** (float to int where appropriate)
- **Human-readable field mapping** with descriptive column names
- **Comprehensive validation checks** at each pipeline stage

## Usage Recommendations

### For Travel Model Two Integration:
1. **Use households_2023_tm2.csv** as primary household input file
2. **Use persons_2023_tm2.csv** as primary person input file
3. **Validate geographic identifiers** (MAZ, TAZ) against model network
4. **Verify Group Quarters** populations align with institutional locations

### For Analysis and Validation:
1. **Reference summary_melt.csv** for control vs result comparisons
2. **Check OUTPUT_FILES_SUMMARY.md** for detailed field distributions
3. **Review GROUP_QUARTERS_ANALYSIS.md** for GQ-specific validation
4. **Use PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.txt** for overall synthesis quality metrics
