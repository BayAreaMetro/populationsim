# PopulationSim TM2 Bay Area - Corrected Analysis Results

## Performance Summary

**EXCELLENT Performance Confirmed**: PopulationSim shows only -0.877% under-allocation of regular households.

### Key Metrics
- **Target Non-GQ Households**: 3,031,796
- **Synthetic Regular Households**: 3,005,220.0
- **Net Difference**: -26,576.0 (-0.877%)
- **R-squared**: 0.892817

### MAZ Performance Distribution
- **Perfect Matches**: 31,052 MAZs (78.4%)
- **Total MAZs**: 39,585

### Group Quarters Handling
- **GQ Households Created**: 205,145
- **Previous Issue**: These were incorrectly included in household performance metrics

## Key Discovery

The apparent "over-allocation" problem was actually a **measurement methodology error**:

- **Old Approach**: Compared MAZ non-GQ targets vs ALL synthetic households
- **New Approach**: Compare MAZ non-GQ targets vs synthetic regular households only
- **Result**: Revealed excellent performance instead of concerning bias

## Conclusion

PopulationSim TM2 Bay Area synthesis demonstrates **excellent performance** with minimal bias 
and strong correlation between targets and results. The synthesis run produced high-quality 
results ready for travel modeling applications.
