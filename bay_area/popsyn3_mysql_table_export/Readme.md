The csv files in this directory are exported directly from mysql after being setup via [popsyn3 scripts](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/popsyn3/tree/master/scripts)

The maz/taz geographies referred to are thus the Travel Model Two version 1.0 geographies.

The tableau workbooks compare the popsyn3 totals to the populationsim totals at a county level as a basic sanity check.
