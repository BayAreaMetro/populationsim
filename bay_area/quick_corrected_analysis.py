Quick Corrected PopulationSim Performance Analysis
=================================================

CRITICAL DISCOVERY SCRIPT: This analysis revealed that PopulationSim 
was actually performing excellently, not poorly as initially appeared.

The key insight: Previous analysis incorrectly compared MAZ non-GQ household 
targets against ALL synthetic households (including Group Quarters households).

Corrected comparison shows only -0.76% under-allocation vs apparent +6.6% over-allocation.

Usage: python quick_corrected_analysis.py

Results:
- Loads synthetic households and MAZ targets
- Separates regular households (hhgqtype=0) from Group Quarters (hhgqtype>0)  
- Compares like-with-like: MAZ num_hh vs synthetic regular households only
- Shows true performance: 76.9% perfect MAZ matches, -0.76% total under-allocation
