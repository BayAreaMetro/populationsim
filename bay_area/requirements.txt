# PopulationSim TM2 WORKING REQUIREMENTS
# Updated August 2025 - Tested and Working Setup

# CRITICAL SETUP NOTES:
# 1. Use Python 3.8.20 (NOT 3.12 - has compatibility issues)
# 2. Create environment with: conda env create -f environment_minimal.yml
# 3. DO NOT use this requirements.txt directly - it's for reference only
# 4. The minimal environment installs PopulationSim automatically

# WORKING ENVIRONMENT PROCESS:
# conda env create -f environment_minimal.yml
# C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\anaconda3\envs\popsim_working\python.exe --version
